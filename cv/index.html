<h3 id="neo4jhttpsneo4jcom"><a href="https://neo4j.com">Neo4j</a></h3>
<p><strong>July 2017 - Present — Remote (London, UK)</strong></p>
<p>Neo4j Inc. is a Swedish Startup and developer of the Graph Database <a href="https://neo4j.com">Neo4j</a>. Neo4j is recognised as the market leader in the <strong>Graph Database</strong> space, and was responsible for the creation of the category back in 2007.  Graph databases treat the connections between data as important as the data itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Developer Education Lead - Developer Relations — March 2021 — Present</strong><br>
Following on from my experience as a Professional Services consultant, teaching developers to use Neo4j on a daily basis, I was asked to analyse how we as a company teach our developers and make any improvements necessary.  After conducting user interviews, my research showed that our courses were good but the theory-heavy nature was not best suited to our target audience - impatient developers. The research also confirmed several assumptions and provided a long list of improvements.<br>
<br>
As a result of the research, I started work on a new Learning Management System and set of courses that provided a more hands-on and interactive learning experience.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GraphAcademy</strong><br>
GraphAcademy is Neo4j&rsquo;s free, self-paced online training platform and features a wide range of courses for users of all experience levels.  You can view the new version of GraphAcademy at <a href="https://graphacademy.neo4j.com">graphacademy.neo4j.com</a>.<br>
<em>Technology: TypeScript, Express.js, Neo4j, Asciidoc &amp; Asciidoctor.js</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Developer Experience Engineer - Developer Relations</strong> — <em>March 2020 — March 2021</em><br>
My broad goal within this role was to <em>improve developer experience</em> across the Neo4j platform that would in turn increase developer adoption.  This meant advocating for our users and communicating their needs to the appropriate departments.  Where bandwidth was unavailable, this also meant developing prototypes and standalone solutions to improve the Developer&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Revamp Developer Guides and Documentation —</strong> <em>May 2020 — Ongoing</em><br>
Documentation is a key part of developer adoption.  Internally, the preview/build/deployment process based on legacy technologies was also cumbersome and slow.  I took it upon myself to improve the overall layout and presentation of the content and also work on improving the deployment process.
The new design was also adopted by the Docs team.<br>
<em>Technology: Asciidoctor, Antora, HTML &amp; CSS, Node.js</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Graph App Development</strong><br>
I built several Graph Apps for Neo4j Desktop, including the <em>Neosemantics Graph App</em>, a tool designed to make it easier to learn and use the <em>Neosemantics (n10s)</em> library and <em>Charts</em> - a tool for quickly turning graph data into easy to understand dashboards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Source Development</strong><br>
This role provided me with the opportunity to contribute to the Open Source community by developing several libraries and frameworks to reduce boilerplate code and allowing users to get started as quickly as possible.  Some highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adam-cowley/use-neo4j">use-neo4j Hooks for React</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adam-cowley/nest-neo4j">nest-neo4j Module for the Nest.js framework and Neo4j</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adam-cowley/neode">neode - a JavaScript OGM for Neo4j</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Senior Professional Services Consultant — July 2017 — March 2020</strong><br>
My consultancy allowed me to help clients across EMEA to be successful with Neo4j.  The role covered everything from small engagements <em>Consultancy</em> and <em>Bootcamps</em>, to <em>Innovation Labs</em> and long term consulting engagements.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fraud Detection &amp; Customer Service Solutions for a large Scandinavian Bank</strong>  <em>— Oslo, Norway, 2018</em><br>
I worked with one of Scandinavia&rsquo;s largest banks to experiment and develop graph-based solutions in Customer Service and Fraud Detection.  All solutions integrated with Microsoft SQL Server-based Data Lakes and other third-party systems, with UI&rsquo;s built as Graph Apps on top of Neo4j Desktop.<br>
<em>Technologies: Neo4j, Vue.js, Microsoft SQL Server, BigQuery</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Innovation Lab for a large Industrial Service company</strong>  <em>— Amsterdam, Netherlands, 2018</em><br>
Working alongside the Global Head of Business Design and the Innovation Lab team, I worked to quickly prototype a knowledge graph and UI to simplify data discovery within a single week.  The project covered a wide range of techniques from data modelling and import to advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP).<br>
<em>Technologies: Neo4j, Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Training &amp; On-going Support for an AI Startup in the Retail space</strong> <em>— 2018</em><br>
After five days of additional training, I supported a new development team to deliver an ambitious project that optimises the sales process across multiple channels.<br>
<em>Technologies: Neo4j, Kafka, React, GraphQL, Java, Spring Boot.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Routing API for a well-known Telco</strong> <em>— 2019</em><br>
Using Neo4j&rsquo;s Traversal API, I helped build a complicated rules-based traversal engine that provides real-time routing for voice and video data across a large network.  The engine considers many factors when calculating a route including network capacity, current load and planned &amp; real-time network outages.  The project also included a visual component that allowed you to visualise potential routes on a map.<br>
<em>Technologies: Neo4j, Java, Vue.js, WebGL</em></p>

<h3 id="company-founder--development-lead--commit">Company Founder &amp; Development Lead — Commit</h3>
<p><strong>April 2015 - April 2019 — Swindon, Wiltshire, UK</strong></p>
<p>At Commit we used the latest technologies, techniques and methodologies to bring ideas to life. The idea was to cut out the middlemen and form a direct relationship between the client and the developer. We designed, built and hosted websites and web apps for a wide range of clients from small start-ups to global companies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Forms Portal - GWR — Summer 2016</strong><br>
The standout project delivered by Commit was a hybrid Web App and Mobile app that allowed GWR to produce forms through an admin panel and collect data through web or mobile.  The system was delivered in three months over Summer 2016 and continues to be used to this day.<br>

In 2013 I lead the development of a UI for a streaming platform called HP Connected Music.

Along with site branded for HP, the web platform was designed to be white-labelled. The platform was taken offline around 2016.<br>
