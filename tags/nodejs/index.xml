      <description>In this post, I will demonstrate how you can build a real-time application on top of Neo4j using a few open source plugins. Due to brevity, this will only be a basic application but you can take the principles and make it as complicated as you need.
For this example, I will also be using Vue.js on top of an express server communicating through websockets. If you prefer something like React then it will work just as well.</description>

      <description>In my last post I wrote an introduction to the five new Neo4j Temporal data types now supported in Neo4j 3.4. Although the functions themselves are laid out in the detailed documentation, information on how to use these data types in an application are still thin on the ground. In this post, I will walk through a few code samples including how to save temporal data types to the graph and how to retrieve them.</description>
