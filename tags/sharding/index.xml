      <description>When you are dealing with large volumes of data, you may need to shard your graph across many physical servers. A quick google search will tell you that:
 Sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases the into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards. The word shard means a small part of a whole.
 In essence, if your data is too large to fit on a single server (and with hardware capabilities and costs, we&amp;rsquo;re talking terrabytes worth), you should consider sharding.</description>
