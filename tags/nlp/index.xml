      <description>When extracting information from documents using NLP, attempting to separate important terms from noise can be tricky. By Calculating a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) score, you can elevate important terms in a document compared to the document set overall. This is a nice addition to the Bag of Words approach to Natural Language Processing because it dampens the score of commonly mentioned terms that do not contain as much informational content.</description>
