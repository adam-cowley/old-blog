      <description>In this post, I will demonstrate how you can build a real-time application on top of Neo4j using a few open source plugins. Due to brevity, this will only be a basic application but you can take the principles and make it as complicated as you need.
For this example, I will also be using Vue.js on top of an express server communicating through websockets. If you prefer something like React then it will work just as well.</description>
