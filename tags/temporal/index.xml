      <description>In my last post I wrote an introduction to the five new Neo4j Temporal data types now supported in Neo4j 3.4. Although the functions themselves are laid out in the detailed documentation, information on how to use these data types in an application are still thin on the ground. In this post, I will walk through a few code samples including how to save temporal data types to the graph and how to retrieve them.</description>

TL;DR: Jump to&amp;#8230;  Clocks Dates Times Local Dates and Times Durations Truncating Values Config Changes Converting Dates Working Example  When I first started using Neo4j back in 2014, I can remember one thing was missing &amp;#8211; support for native date datatype.</description>
