      <description>A big change in the 4.0 release of Neo4j is the introduction of multiple databases in Enterprise Edition. Previous to 4.0, you could only have a single instance of Neo4j running a single database on any port at any time. This made multi-tenancy a problem because you had to build the segregation of data into the application layer.
Now, you can create, start and stop multipel databases on the same Neo4j instance.</description>
