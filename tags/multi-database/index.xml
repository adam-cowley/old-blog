      <description>The introduction of multi-database in Neo4j 4.0 has certainly made the lives of aspiring SaaS vendors. Previously to 4.0, it was only possible to run one instance of a Neo4j database on a server at any time. This meant a lot of effort around standing up Neo4j instances for customers of SaaS services. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as running a CREATE DATABASE command against the system database.

      <description>A big change in the 4.0 release of Neo4j is the introduction of multiple databases in Enterprise Edition. Previous to 4.0, you could only have a single instance of Neo4j running a single database on any port at any time. This made multi-tenancy a problem because you had to build the segregation of data into the application layer.
Now, you can create, start and stop multiple databases on the same Neo4j instance.</description>
